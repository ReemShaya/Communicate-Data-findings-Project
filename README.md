# (Ford GoBike System Data)
## by (Reem Shaya)

In this project, I will use Python libraries for data cleaning and data visualization in order to explore and learn about data set variables and understand data structure, anomalies, patterns, and relationships.

## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bike share system, with thousands of bikes at hundreds of station in San Francisco, San Jose and the East Bay.


## Summary of Findings

> 1- The number of subscribed users is more than the clients, where the subscribers amount to 158,386 and the clients are 16,566
> 
> 2- The largest category we have is the category of men, where they represent nearly three quarters of the data.. The number is precisely 130,500, followed by the females whose number is 40,805 and finally the unspecified category and they reach  Only 3647
>
> 3- The number of flights is high for people aged between 20 and 60
>
> 4- Most of the people whose flights increase are those born in 1980 to 2000 
>
> 5- Women whose ages range between 1950 and 1990 are very few and in some years it is not mentioned


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focused on the basic elements and how they interrelate and relate to each other.  Like clarifying the users' gender and age groups as well as characteristics like how long they ride, I made sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it was clearly different between plots.
